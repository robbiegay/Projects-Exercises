### MVP

By default, the app should GET JSON data from the internet to your machine

#### Wireframe

![wireframe](../wireframes/api-php-1.png)

#### Tech Stack

1. PHP

### Process

##### Setup:

1. Create repo, for example: `my-app`
2. Locally, navigate to your `sites` folder in the terminal
3. `git clone` + `your-repo-name` into your Sites folder
4. Create necessary files for application and view in VS Code
   - Run shell script to expedite process unless you are using a framework
   - _If you are using a framework, disregard the "Application File Structure" section_
5. Import and route necessary css/js files (E.g. Bootstrap)
6. Save all and create your first commit to `master`

###### Application File Structure

Minimally:

```
web/
    index.php - main page
README.md - any important information
.gitignore - file that omits any directory/file from being tracked
```

Additional pages will be relative to the index.html file.

It is okay if your project has more files and directories, but you at least need the ones listed above.

##### Develop:

1. Create a `dev` branch to commit your code to
2. View changes and test locally
3. Save often, and commit to your development branch on GitHub when important changes happen
4. Push your commits to GitHub remote

##### Deploy:

1. Create a Pull Request from `dev` into `master`
2. Confirm code is up to date and works correctly
3. Post links to your GitHub repo to the Projects and Exercises Slack channel

### Requirements

To complete the assignment, you must complete the following:

1. Install [Allow CORS Google Chrome Plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi)
2. Create a PHP script that runs a GET request on `localhost port 3000` that uses [JSON_decode()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.json-decode.php) to grab the file from `{your-ip-address:8080/your-file.json`
3. Display the raw data on screen to confirm it works (do not skip this step, very important)
4. Parse the raw data and create a basic interface to allow a user to perform CRUD Actions on the data
5. Perform CRUD actions on data ([POST, GET, PATCH, DELETE, etc.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods)) and update the data on the API 8080 webserver via POST.
6. Confirm data in server(8080) is indeed updated when client updates(3000)

#### Additional Requirements

- Website must be responsive
- Style your app as you wish
- Use the tools and technologies covered in class to complete your website. To see what we have covered, check the [Class Resources Repo](https://github.com/bootcamp-students/Resources).
- Your repo should be public so that others can see your code and comment on it.
  - _**Remember to push to GitHub!**_
  - Potential employers will view your GitHub profile, so activity is crucial!

#### Stretch Goals

- Use API credentials to only allow access to users with an API key
- [Use reactstrap to dynamically display data in table](http://reactstrap.github.io/components/tables/)

#### If you finish early...

1. Continue to add your own content, additions, and pages to your site and improve the styling.
2. Add info to your projects README.md [README.md Best Practices](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2)
3. Add links and resources from this week to the [Class Resources Repo](https://github.com/bootcamp-students/Resources) by forking the repo and then initiating a pull request with your additions to the .md file.
